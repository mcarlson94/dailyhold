Build DailyHold.co - A Daily 1-Minute Hold Challenge Website
Create a simple, mobile-friendly website called DailyHold.co with the following features:
Landing Page:

Clean, minimalist design with light blue/gray background (#d4dfe6 or similar)
Center-aligned content
Logo at top: Use the "Daily Hold" logo featuring:

Italic dark green text "Daily Hold"
Stopwatch icon integrated into the design (top right of text)
Silhouette of person in plank position below the text
All elements in dark green (#2d5446 or similar)


Large "START" button centered below logo (dark green with white text, rounded pill shape)

Timer Functionality:

When user clicks START, immediately begin a 60-second countdown timer
Display the timer prominently in the center of the screen (large font, dark green)
Timer should count down from 60 to 0 in seconds format (e.g., "60", "59", "58"... "0")
Show "Hold..." text above the timer
Keep logo visible but smaller at top of screen during countdown
Option to cancel/stop if user needs to quit

Completion Modal:

When timer reaches 0, display a modal popup overlay (similar to DailyTens)
Modal should have dark green background with white text
Display at top: "DailyHold [current date in M/D format]" (e.g., "DailyHold 1/15" for January 15th)
Large green checkmark ✅ emoji centered below
Text: "Share to see how your friends and family do!"
Large "SHARE" button at bottom (dark color with white text)
Small X button in top right corner to close modal
Display countdown timer showing time until next daily challenge (e.g., "New hold in: HH:MM:SS")

Share Functionality:

When SHARE button clicked, use Web Share API (or fallback to clipboard copy)
Share text format (use TODAY'S ACTUAL DATE in M/D format):

  DailyHold 1/15
  ✅
  
  dailyhold.co
IMPORTANT: The date (1/15) should be dynamically generated as today's date in M/D format (January 15 = 1/15, January 28 = 1/28, February 3 = 2/3, etc.)
Logo Design Requirements:

Create the logo using SVG or CSS for the plank silhouette and stopwatch
Dark green color (#2d5446) for all logo elements
Italic, bold font for "Daily Hold" text
Stopwatch icon positioned at top right of text with curved line
Person in plank position below, showing proper form
Logo should be responsive and scale well on mobile

Technical Requirements:

Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks needed)
Mobile-responsive design
Works on iOS Safari
Store completion in localStorage to prevent multiple completions per day
Calculate date-based resets (new challenge available at midnight)
Use JavaScript Date object to get current date for display and sharing

Design Notes:

Light blue/gray background: #d4dfe6
Dark green accents: #2d5446
Clean, modern typography
Smooth animations/transitions for modal appearance
Mobile-first design approach

Please build this as a single-page application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include the logo as described or request the logo image file if needed.
